    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons coconut milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sift flour, baking soda, and salt into a bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Beat sugar and vegan margarine in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer
        until creamy, about 2 minutes. Mix in vanilla. Stir in flour mixture
        until incorporated, then add coconut milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until
        dough comes together. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking
        sheets with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll chilled dough on a floured surface to a thickness of 1/4 to 1/2
        inch. Dip a cookie cutter in flour and cut out cookies, re-flouring as
        needed. Place cookies onto the prepared baking sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until just turning golden, about 10 minutes.
